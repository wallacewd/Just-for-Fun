# Python ideas for beginners
Miscellaneous code ideas for new programmers

Welcome! This is a collection of fun code ideas for python beginners looking to sharpen their skills.
This is not a tutorial! However, I hope those who are starting out with python can reverse-engineer these scripts and make them their own. 
If you are looking for codes to practice with, feel free to mess around with these! I'm sure there are even better ways to appoach these problems, so have at it!
